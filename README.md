# Walmart-Sales-Analysis---SQL_t
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts demonstrating various data analysis tasks, including adding new columns, exploring data characteristics, and performing advanced analytical queries using SQL window functions, CTE's

Welcome to the SQL Data Analysis Project repository! This repository aims to provide a hands-on approach to SQL data analysis, offering a diverse collection of SQL scripts tailored to address different data analysis challenges. Below is an overview of the contents and how to navigate through them:

Data Exploration and Transformation:
The initial scripts focus on adding new columns to the dataset to enhance its analytical capabilities. These include adding time-related columns like "time_of_date," "day_of_the_week," and "month," which enable time-based analysis.

Basic Analysis:
Next, we delve into basic analysis tasks such as identifying unique values in columns, determining the number of transactions per customer type, and exploring payment methods and customer demographics.
Advanced Analysis with Window Functions:
The core of this repository lies in the advanced analytical queries using SQL window functions. These queries tackle complex analysis tasks, including ranking, aggregation, and partitioning data to derive meaningful insights.
Summary and Conclusions:
Finally, we wrap up with summary queries, which provide aggregated insights such as total revenue by month, most common payment methods, and highest average VAT by product line.
